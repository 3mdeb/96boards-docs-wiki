h2. Reference Software Platform

The Reference Software Platform Lead Project is part of the Linaro 96Boards initiative. The goal of the project is to deliver Linaro output for ARM SoCs using 96Boards products for use cases ranging from the Embedded to the Enterprise segments. The releases may contain bootloader, kernel, distribution and/or user level middleware/applications. The releases will comprise loadable software for 96Boards products, reference source code, and documentation on building the source code, any hardware dependencies including porting tips for other SoCs, and configurations chosen for the reference builds.

Please check this "video":http://connect.linaro.org/resource/sfo15/sfo15-104-the-96boards-software-reference-platform/ from Linaro Connect (SFO15) for more information about the Reference Software Platform project.
