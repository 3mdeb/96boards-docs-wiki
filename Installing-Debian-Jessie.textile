h2. Installing Debian "Jessie" 8.2

This guide is not to be a replacement of the official Debian Installer documentation, but instead be a quick walkthrough for the network installer. You can find the original documentation at "https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/arm64/index.html.en":https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/arm64/index.html.en

h3. Setting up the TFTP server

Back to your dnsmasq server (check "this link":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/DHCP-TFTP-server-for-UEFI-distro-network-installers for instructions on how to setup your own TFTP/DCHP server), download the required Debian installer files at your tftp-root directory. In this example, this directory is configured to @/srv/tftp@. As part of this example we're using the same Grub 2 that is provided by Fedora 23 (TODO: update for the Debian or common grub 2).

Downloading required Grub 2 UEFI files:

*Note:* Because of bug "1251600":https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1251600, we need to use both @BOOTAA64.EFI@ and @grubaa64.efi@ from the Fedora 22 release.

bc. sudo su -
cd /srv/tftp/
wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/22/Server/aarch64/os/EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI
wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/22/Server/aarch64/os/EFI/BOOT/grubaa64.efi

Downloading upstream Kernel and Initrd

bc. mkdir /srv/tftp/debian
cd /srv/tftp/debian
wget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie/main/installer-arm64/current/images/netboot/debian-installer/arm64/linux
wget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie/main/installer-arm64/current/images/netboot/debian-installer/arm64/initrd.gz

Creating the Grub 2 config file (@grub.cfg@):

bc. menuentry 'Install Debian 64-bit' --class debian --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
    linux (tftp)/debian/linux
    initrd (tftp)/debian/initrd.gz
}

You should now have the following file tree structure:

bc. /srv/tftp/
├── BOOTAA64.EFI
├── debian
│   ├── initrd.gz
│   └── linux
├── grubaa64.efi
└── grub.cfg

Now just make sure that @/etc/dnsmasq.conf@ is pointing out to the right boot file, like:

bc. dhcp-boot=BOOTAA64.EFI

h3. Booting the installer

Now boot your platform of choice, selecting PXE boot when presented by UEFI (make sure to boot with the right network interface, in case more than one is available).

You should see the following (using AMD Seattle's Overdrive as example):

bc. NOTICE:  BL3-1:

 Fetching Netboot Image

At this stage you should be able to see the Grub 2 menu, like:

bc. Install Debian 64-bit
.
Use the  and  keys to change the selection.                       
Press 'e' to edit the selected item, or 'c' for a command prompt.

Now just hit enter and wait for the kernel and initrd to load, which automatically loads the installer and provides you the installer console menu, so you can finally install Debian.

TODO: update the kernel and image used, since the kernel from jessie doesn't work well with Seattle.

h3. Finishing the installation

For using the installer, please check the documentation available at "https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/arm64/ch06.html.en":https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/arm64/ch06.html.en

Once the installation is completed, you should be able to simply reboot the system in order to boot your new Debian system.
