h4. Reference Platform Builds - 15.12

The *15.12* release is the second official release for the Reference Software Platform project, and for the first time also including support for the Enterprise Edition. Since there is still no availability for the AMD HuskyBoard, the first EE RPB was produced using the current enterprise development boards that are available in Linaro, such as HiSilicon D02 and AMD Overdrive (same SoC from HuskyBoard, known as Seattle). Once HuskBoard is available, the work for making it supported by the EE RPB should be minimal.

A lot of work was put in place for the EE RPB, covering firmware (UEFI/EDK2), Linux 4.4 (with ACPI), Debian/CentOS network installers, OpenStack Liberty, Hadoop, Spark and a few others, consolidating the work from several other Linaro groups and teams as well as from community and members.
