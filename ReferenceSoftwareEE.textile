h2. Reference Software Platform Enterprise Edition

Draft for EE specific instructions and documentation.

h3. Setting up DHCP/TFTP server for network installers

Example using dnsmasq, which is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server with BOOTP/TFTP/PXE functionality.

Debian/Ubuntu:

bc. sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:

bc. yum install dnsmasq

This guide assumes you already know the network interface that will provide the DHCP/TFTP/PXE functionality for the target server. In this case, we are using @eth1@ as our secondary interface, with address @192.168.3.1@.

Following is the /etc/dnsmasq.conf providing the required functionality for PXE:

bc. interface=eth1
dhcp-range=192.168.3.10,192.168.3.100,255.255.255.0,1h
dhcp-boot=BOOTAA64.EFI
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/srv/tftp

Now make sure the tftp-root directory is available, and then start/restart the dnsmasq service:

bc. sudo mkdir -p /srv/tftp
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq

Since this guide assumes UEFI support, you don't need to worry about pxelinux specific configurations. All we need is to give DHCP the UEFI binary for the Grub 2 bootloader (that can then load the kernel, initrd and other extra files from the tftp server).
