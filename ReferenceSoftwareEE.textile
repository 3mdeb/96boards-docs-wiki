h2. Reference Platform (Enterprise Edition)

h3. Boot Firmware

The "UEFI/EDK2 guide for EE":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/UEFI-EDK2-Guide-for-EE provides information about building and flashing the boot firmware for the supported boards.

h3. Reference Platform Kernel

The Reference Platform kernel used by the enterprise release (and soon to be shared with CE) can be found on "git.linaro.org":https://git.linaro.org/people/amit.kucheria/kernel.git/shortlog/refs/heads/96b/releases/2015.12

Since we want the same kernel config to be used for all our builds and distributions, it is also available as part of the same kernel tree, and can be found at "arch/arm64/configs/distro.config":https://git.linaro.org/people/amit.kucheria/kernel.git/blob/refs/heads/96b/releases/2015.12:/arch/arm64/configs/distro.config

At the time of the 15.12 release, the kernel is based on *4.4-rc4*.

For future releases we will also have kernel config fragments for key functionality that will make it easier for other projects and distributions to consume.

The Reference Platform kernel will act as an integration point (very similar to linux-next) for various upstream-targeted features and platform-enablement code on the latest kernel. Please read the "kernel policy":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/RP-Kernel-Policy on how this kernel will be maintained. It is not meant to be a stable kernel - the "LSK":https://wiki.linaro.org/LSK is already available for that.

h3. Quick Start

h4. AMD Overdrive

Since the EDK2 based firmware is not yet supported (work in progress), the original AMI BIOS based firmware from AMD is required.

At the time of the 15.12 release the latest firmware version for Overdrive (*B0*) is 0.0.8.5.

Only *B0* is supported by the 15.12 release.

After flashing/updating the firmware, proceed to the network installer instructions in order to install your favorite distribution. No special setup is required for Overdrive.

h5. Flashing the firmware

Follow the instructions available as part of the "UEFI EDK2 Guide":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/UEFI-EDK2-Guide-for-EE#amd-overdrive in order to flash your AMD Overdrive. The tested flashing process requires "DediProg SF100":http://www.dediprog.com/pd/spi-flash-solution/SF100, but a board like the "SPI Hook":http://www.tincantools.com/SPI_Hook.html should also be compatible with it (not yet tested).

h4. HiSilicon D02

UEFI/EDK2 is supported by D02 (with build from source instructions available as part of the "UEFI EDK2 Guide":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/UEFI-EDK2-Guide-for-EE#building), and since ACPI support is new, please make sure you are using the latest firmware available at "https://builds.96boards.org/snapshots/reference-platform/components/uefi/latest/release/d02/":https://builds.96boards.org/snapshots/reference-platform/components/uefi/latest/release/d02/ before proceeding with kernel testing or installing your favorite distribution (and please make sure to report your firmware version when reporting issues and bugs).

h5. Flashing the firmware

Follow the instructions available as part of the "UEFI EDK2 Guide":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/UEFI-EDK2-Guide-for-EE#d02 in order to flash your D02. The tested flashing process only requires access to a TFTP server, since the firmware supports fetching the firmware from the network.

h3. Network Installers

In order to install a distribution from network, PXE (DCHP/TFTP) booting is required. Since we require UEFI for the Enterprise Edition, the setup is usually easier since all you need is to load GRUB 2 (and its configuration). Check "this link":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/DHCP-TFTP-server-for-UEFI-distro-network-installers for instructions on how to quickly setup your own PXE server (using *dnsmasq*).

Install instructions for the tested/supported distributions:
* "Debian 8.x 'Jessie'":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/Installing-Debian-Jessie
* "CentOS 7":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/Installing-CentOS-7

h4. Other distributions

Only Debian and CentOS are officially released and validated as part of the reference software platform project, but other distributions can be easily supported as well (just need kernel and installer changes).

Extra resources for other distributions:
* "Fedora 23":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/Installing-Fedora-23
