h3. Network Installers

In order to install a distribution from network, PXE (DCHP/TFTP) booting is required. Since we requires UEFI for for the Enterprise Edition, the setup is usually easier since all is usually required is GRUB 2 (and its configuration). Check "this link":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/DHCP-TFTP-server-for-UEFI-distro-network-installers for instructions on how to quickly setup your own PXE server (using *dnsmasq*).
