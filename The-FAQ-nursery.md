# Meta-topics

_The meta-questions describe the role of this document. The questions in this section should not be copied into the FAQ._

**Q: What is the FAQ nursery?**

One meaning of nursery is to describes a business that grows young plant until they are strong enough to be sold in a garden centre. In the same way that a nursery nurtures immature plants until they are ready to face the world, the FAQ nursery allows FAQs to be collaboratively edited (in markdown format) whilst they are not ready to be shared on the forum.

The nursery is, by design, not the place to come for complete (or even coherent) answers. It is a place to come to write, propose and savagely edit our frequently-asked-questions.

**Q: How should I phrase questions?**

FAQs are presented as questions and answers and it is important that the question is a question, rather than a title. It should read as a full English sentence that requests information.

**Q: What is the right tone (of language) for answers?**

A FAQ is *not* documentation and need not adopt the formal approach commonly found in technical documentation. Instead answers in a FAQ should adopt the more informal tone we expect to find on the forum. 

# General

**Q: What is the best way to ask questions on the forum?**

Firstly, consider checking to see if anyone else has asked a similar question. I'd recommend using a full search engine since that is more powerful than the search box built into the forum, for example if you use google just add <code>site:96boards.org</code> to limit you search to the forums (and the 96Boards documentation).

Otherwise the best thing to do is to start a new topic and give it a good title. The title appears in the side bar on the forum and gets lots of visibility. A good title will tend to attract better answers.

**Q: Where is the documentation for the Bubblegum-96?**

We're busy working on it. In the mean time take a look at https://github.com/96boards-bubblegum/linaro-adfu-tool to see how to FLASH different operating systems onto your Bubblegum-96.

**Q: Why is this section empty?**

The board is still being tested and enabled. Not many people have Cello's on their desks at this point so no questions have been frequently asked!
