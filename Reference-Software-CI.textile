h2. Reference Software Platform - CI

List of current CI jobs ("ci.linaro.org":https://ci.linaro.org/) which are maintained as part of the Reference Software Platform lead project.

* "Reference GRUB":https://ci.linaro.org/view/96boards/job/96boards-reference-grub-efi-arm64/
** Created so we can start moving the grub logic into a more desktop-standard behavior
** Grub built to search for the root file system via labels, and loads kernel, initrd and grub.conf from the rootfs (system partition)

* "Refence UEFI":https://ci.linaro.org/view/96boards/job/96boards-reference-uefi/
** Created to avoid conflicts and issues with the branch and build job used by the hikey member images
** Useful for upstreaming work and early bringup
** Later on this job might not be required, and simply migrated to the Linaro EDK2 tree

* "Reference Kernel":https://ci.linaro.org/view/96boards/job/96boards-reference-kernel/
** Consumes and builds the common kernel tree that is maintained by Amit
** Not yet used by any of the builds

* "Reference Kernel - Matrix":https://ci.linaro.org/view/96boards/job/96boards-reference-kernel-matrix/
** Similar to the main reference kernel job, but uses trees/branches that are based from the landing team trees
** To be used until we can get the reference tree in place
** Job responsible for producing the kernel used by the Debian RPBs

* "Reference Build - AOSP":https://ci.linaro.org/view/96boards/job/96boards-reference-platform-aosp/
** Same tree and job previously done by Vishal
** To be migrated to a 4.1 based kernel, once ready
** Dragonboard 410c not yet supported

* "Reference Build - Debian":https://ci.linaro.org/view/96boards/job/96boards-reference-platform-debian/
** Using the reference components (grub, uefi, kernel)
** Matrix job that will be extended to support additional boards
** Rootfs is shared with the other builds, effort to make the changes generic enough to be used by others
