h2. UEFI/EDK2

EDK2 is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and PI specifications.

The reference UEFI/EDK2 tree used by the EE-RPB comes from Linaro, which is available at "https://git.linaro.org/uefi/linaro-edk2.git":https://git.linaro.org/uefi/linaro-edk2.git

The Linaro EDK2 tree is based on upstream (with constant rebases), covered by monthly validation and releases, in order to provide a more stable reference. This tree also contains two extra git submodules, LinaroPkg and OpenPlatformPkg, with the latter providing the hardware specific support and drivers (since EDK2 upstream only provides the common and generic pieces).

EDK2 is currently used by 96boards HuskyBoard, AMD Overdrive, ARM Juno r0/r1 and HiSilicon D02.

This guide provides enough information on how to build UEFI/EDK2 from scratch, but meant to be a quick guide. For further information please also check the official Linaro UEFI documentation, available at "https://wiki.linaro.org/ARM/UEFI":https://wiki.linaro.org/ARM/UEFI and  "https://wiki.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Kernel/UEFI/build":https://wiki.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Kernel/UEFI/build

h3. Building

h4. Pre-Requisites

Make sure the build dependencies are available at your host machine.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

bc. sudo apt-get install uuid-dev build-essential

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:

bc. sudo yum install uuid-devel libuuid-devel

If cross compiling, you also need to separately add the required toolchains. Ubuntu has a prebuilt arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain, but not an aarch64-linux-gnu one.

Download Linaro's GCC 4.9 cross-toolchain for Aarch64, and make it available in your @PATH@. You can download and use the Linaro GCC binary (Linaro GCC 4.9-2015.02), available at "http://releases.linaro.org/15.02/components/toolchain/binaries/aarch64-linux-gnu/gcc-linaro-4.9-2015.02-3-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz":http://releases.linaro.org/15.02/components/toolchain/binaries/aarch64-linux-gnu/gcc-linaro-4.9-2015.02-3-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz

bc. mkdir arm-tc arm64-tc
tar --strip-components=1 -C ${PWD}/arm-tc -xf gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.9-*_linux.tar.xz
tar --strip-components=1 -C ${PWD}/arm64-tc -xf gcc-linaro-aarch64-linux-gnu-4.9-*_linux.tar.xz
export PATH="${PWD}/arm-tc/bin:${PWD}/arm64-tc/bin:$PATH"

h4. Getting the source code

UEFI/EDK2:

bc. git clone -b release --depth 1 http://git.linaro.org/git/uefi/linaro-edk2.git

ARM Trusted Firmware:

bc. git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware.git

UEFI Tools (helpers and scripts to make the build process easy):

bc. git clone git://git.linaro.org/uefi/uefi-tools.git

h4. Building UEFI/EDK2 for Juno R0/R1

bc. export AARCH64_TOOLCHAIN=GCC49
export EDK2_DIR=${PWD}/linaro-edk2
export UEFI_TOOLS_DIR=${PWD}/uefi-tools
cd ${EDK2_DIR}
${UEFI_TOOLS_DIR}/uefi-build.sh -b RELEASE -a ../arm-trusted-firmware juno

The output files:

* @Build/ArmJuno/RELEASE_GCC49/AARCH64/FV/BL33_AP_UEFI.fd@ - UEFI

h4. Building UEFI/EDK2 for D02

bc. export AARCH64_TOOLCHAIN=GCC49
export EDK2_DIR=${PWD}/linaro-edk2
export UEFI_TOOLS_DIR=${PWD}/uefi-tools
cd ${EDK2_DIR}
${UEFI_TOOLS_DIR}/uefi-build.sh -b RELEASE D02

The output files:

* @UEFI_D02.fd@
* @CH02TEVBC_V03.bin@

FIXME: Add the correct output files

h3. Flashing

h4. Juno R0/R1

h5. Clean flash

Power on the board, and (if prompted) press Enter to stop auto boot. Once in Juno's boot monitor, use the following commands to erase Juno's flash and export it as an external storage:

bc. Cmd> flash
Flash> eraseall
Flash> quit
Cmd> usb_on

This will delete any binaries and UEFI settings currently stored in the Juno's flash, then mount the Juno's MMC card as an external storage device on your host PC.

From your host PC, delete all files on your Juno's mounted MMC card, then copy the firmware plus the built UEFI:

bc. sudo rm -rf /media/recovery/* # Change to the correct mount path
git clone https://git.linaro.org/arm/vexpress-firmware.git # ARM Firmware for Juno
bc. cp Build/ArmJuno/RELEASE_GCC49/AARCH64/FV/BL33_AP_UEFI.fd vexpress-firmware/SOFTWARE/uefi.bin
cp -rf vexpress-firmware/* /media/recovery

FIXME: Add extra steps for cert create.

Be sure to issue a sync command on your host PC afterwards, which will guarantee that the copy has completed:

bc. sync

Finally, power cycle the Juno. After it has finished copying the contents of the MMC card into Flash, the board will boot up and run the new software images.
