# OpenOCD JTAG and HiKey

I've been working on getting a open source JTAG debugging solution working on HiKey. This page documents the current status, and how to get this setup and working.

## Soldering on the connector
The first step is to solder on the JTAG connector. The unpopulated header is at J10 on the underside of the circuit board. The connector that you need to buy is a "FTSH-105-01-L-DV". It can be purchased from Farnell here (note the image is for a larger connector).

http://uk.farnell.com/samtec/ftsh-105-01-l-dv/header-1-27mm-smd-10way/dp/1667759ï»¿

Once the connector is soldered on it should look something like this

## JTAG device

OpenOCD supports many different JTAG dongles. The one I choose to use was the TinCanTools flyswatter2, which is $89 from http://www.tincantools.com/JTAG/Flyswatter2.html. This is a FTDI based device which is well supported in OpenOCD. The flyswatter2 comes with a variety of cables and adapters. I'm using the standard ARM 20 pin cable. I have then purchased a JTAG (2x10 2.54mm) to SWD (2x5 1.27mm) Cable Adapter Board from AdaFruit.

See http://www.adafruit.com/products/2094?utm_source=contextly&utm_medium=module-related&utm_campaign=129798
and a 10 pin 2x5 1.27mm cable
See http://www.adafruit.com/products/1675?utm_source=contextly&utm_medium=module-related&utm_campaign=129798

Once this is all connected it should look something like this

## OpenOCD source code
The armv8 code isn't currently merged to mainline, the latest code I've found is on the following gerrit http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/2523/.

A GIT repo which is based off this gerrit which also includes a includes a hi6220 configuration file can be cloned here

    git clone ssh://git@git.linaro.org:/people/peter.griffin/openocd-code
    git checkout armv8

## Compiling OpenOCD

Install any pre-requisite libraries (e.g. FTDI libs if your JTAG is FTDI based)

    cd openocd-code
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/
    ./configure --enable-ftdi
    make
    make install

## Running OpenOCD
    src/openocd -f ./tcl/interface/ftdi/flyswatter2.cfg -f ./tcl/target/hi6220.cfg

If all goes well you should see trace like the following: -

Check the following: -
* Soldering of the JTAG connector
* The cables are plugged in securely
* The board is correctly powered.

## Using OpenOCD Telnet interface
Once openocd has connected to the target you can connect via the telnet interface.

    telnet localhost 4444
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.

### Setting a breakpoint

    > bp 0x35000000 4 hw
    breakpoint set at 0x        35000000
    > resume

and in u-boot

    INFO:    BL3-1: Preparing for EL3 exit to normal world
    INFO:    BL3-1: Next image address = 0x35000000
    INFO:    BL3-1: Next image spsr = 0x3c9

    Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0 
    # go 0x35000000
    ## Starting application at 0x35000000 ...

you can see in OpenOCD telnet we hit the breakpoint

    target state: halted
    target halted in ARM64 state due to breakpoint, current mode: EL2H
    cpsr: 0x600003c9 pc: 0x35000000
    MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: disabled

now remove the breakpoint so we can try single stepping

    rbp 0x35000000
    
### Single stepping u-boot

We can validate the last few single steps, with a disassembly of the u-boot binary to validate what happened

    35000078:   d518c000        msr     vbar_el1, x0
    3500007c:   d2a00600        mov     x0, #0x300000                   // #3145728
    35000080:   d5181040        msr     cpacr_el1, x0
    35000084:   94000003        bl      35000090 <apply_core_errata>

### Writing to memory

    > mww 0x36000000 0xdeadbeef

and then validate with u-boot
    # md 0x36000000
