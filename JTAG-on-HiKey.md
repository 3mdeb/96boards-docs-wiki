# OpenOCD JTAG and HiKey

Hikey provides an unpopulated JTAG connector on its underside. It is relatively easy to hand solder on a proper connector and to use inexpensive JTAG interfaces to communicate with the board.

Currently the open-source JTAG debugging solutions are fairly immature for 64-bit ARM platforms. In general the Hikey should be considered a tool to help develop OpenOCD on rather than considering OpenOCD a tool to help you develop on a Hikey!

This page documents the current status, and provide instructions on to to get setup and working.

## Soldering on the connector
The first step is to solder on the JTAG connector. The unpopulated header is at J10 on the underside of the circuit board. The connector that you need to buy is a "FTSH-105-01-L-DV". It can be purchased from Farnell here (note the image is for a larger connector).

http://uk.farnell.com/samtec/ftsh-105-01-l-dv/header-1-27mm-smd-10way/dp/1667759ï»¿

Once the connector is soldered on it should look something like this

## JTAG interfaces

OpenOCD supports many different JTAG interface. The list of devices known to work with the HiKey board includes:

 * [Bus Blaster v3 from Dangerous Prototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Blaster). Set `INTERFACE=interface/ftdi/dp_busblaster_kt-link.cfg` for this adapter. Before connecting the BBv3 to the HiKey ensure the interface is not configured to provide power to the target (JP4, the target power select jumper, **must** be disconnected) otherwise the HiKey could be damaged. The BBv3 buffer logic must be programmed with SVF from https://github.com/bharrisau/busblaster .
 * [Flyswatter2 from Tin Can Tools](http://www.tincantools.com/JTAG/Flyswatter2.html). Set `INTERFACE=interface/ftdi/flyswatter2.cfg` for this adapter.
 * [J-Link from Segger](https://www.segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html). Set `INTERFACE=interface/jlink.cfg`.

Most JTAG interfaces provide a standard ARM 20 pin socket (2x10 2.54mm) meaning an adapter board is required to convert from this to the SWD (2x5 1.27mm). This are available from a variety of sources including:

 * [ARM-JTAG-20-10 from Olimax](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/). This board includes the 10-pin SWD cable and has a female 20 pin IDC connector allowing it to connect directly to most JTAG interfaces without any additional cabling.
 * [JTAG to SWD Cable Adapter Board](http://www.adafruit.com/products/2094) and [150mm 2x5 SWD cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1675) from Adafruit Industries. This board has a male IDC connector meaning an additional 20 pin IDC cable is required to connect to most JTAG interfaces.

Once this is all connected it should look something like thisFT2232H

## OpenOCD source code
The armv8 code isn't currently merged to mainline, the latest code I've found is on the following gerrit http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/2523/.

A GIT repo which is based off this gerrit which also includes a includes a hi6220 configuration file can be cloned here

    git clone ssh://git@git.linaro.org:/people/peter.griffin/openocd-code
    cd openocd-code
    git checkout armv8
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    autoreconf -iv

## Compiling OpenOCD

Install any pre-requisite libraries (e.g. FTDI libs if your JTAG is FTDI based)

    cd openocd-code
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/  # Needed for Debian derived distros
    ./configure --enable-ftdi
    make
    make install

## Running OpenOCD

Firstly ensure everything is connected like the photo above, and power on the board. Then issue the following command

    src/openocd -f ./tcl/$INTERFACE -f ./tcl/target/hi6220.cfg

If all goes well you should see trace like the following: -

... then check the following:
* Soldering of the JTAG connector
* The cables are plugged in securely
* The board is correctly powered.
* Everything is connected like in the photo above

## Using OpenOCD Telnet interface
Once openocd has connected to the target you can connect via the telnet interface.

    telnet localhost 4444
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.

### Setting a breakpoint

_Currently it is not possible to resume the target once Linux has booted (although it can be halted and examined). At present preakpoints are only effective for bootloader development._

    > bp 0x35000000 4 hw
    breakpoint set at 0x        35000000
    > resume

and in u-boot force the processor to jump to this address (which is the start of u-boot)

    INFO:    BL3-1: Preparing for EL3 exit to normal world
    INFO:    BL3-1: Next image address = 0x35000000
    INFO:    BL3-1: Next image spsr = 0x3c9

    Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0 
    # go 0x35000000
    ## Starting application at 0x35000000 ...

you can see in OpenOCD telnet we hit the breakpoint

    target state: halted
    target halted in ARM64 state due to breakpoint, current mode: EL2H
    cpsr: 0x600003c9 pc: 0x35000000
    MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: disabled

now remove the breakpoint so we can try single stepping

    rbp 0x35000000
    
### Single stepping

_Currently it is not possible to resume the target once Linux has booted (although it can be halted and examined). At present single stepping is only effective for bootloader development._

### Debugging U-Boot with GDB

If U-Boot is sat at the prompt, then it has been relocated from its
statically linked address 0x35000000. On my system it gets relocated to
0x3ef47000.

## What isn't working

Probably lots of things - add issues here when you find them :)

Better still debug and fix it!

Sometimes I hit the following GDB assertion when doing a backtrace in U-Boot
* /cbuild/slaves/oorts/crosstool-ng/builds/aarch64-linux-gnu-linux/.build/src/gdb-linaro-7.6.1-2013.10/gdb/regcache.c:178: internal-error: register_size: Assertion `regnum >= 0 && regnum < (gdbarch_num_regs (gdbarch) + gdbarch_num_pseudo_regs (gdbarch))' failed.
